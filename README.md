# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, open two separate tabs:

- `npm start`
- `npm run api` - starts the json-server for fake data. Data was swiped from my personal favorites endopoints, so some functionality may not be present (pagination, for instance.)
